# Python dependencies
# Note: tkinter is usually included with Python, but on some systems
# (especially Linux/WSL) you may need to install it separately:
#
# Ubuntu/Debian/WSL:
#   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#
# Fedora:
#   sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
#
# macOS (with Homebrew):
#   brew install python-tk
